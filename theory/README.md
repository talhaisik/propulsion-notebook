## Guidelines

- **Cite sources:** Always reference textbooks, papers, lectures, or online resources
- **Show work:** Include derivations, not just final equations
- **Be honest:** If you don't understand something, note it and come back to it
- **Update regularly:** These are living documents, not static notes

---

## Format

Use Markdown for all theory documents. Include:
- Clear section headers
- Equations using LaTeX notation: `\( inline \)` or `\[ block \]`
- References at the bottom
- Date of last update

_Start with fundamentals. Build depth over time._
