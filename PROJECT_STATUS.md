   - **Option A:** Start with simulation work (ARC A, Module A1 - Rocket Performance)
     - Set up Python environment (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
     - Begin rocket performance simulation
     - Study propellant chemistry in depth
   - **Option B:** Start with UAV energy modeling (ARC B, Module B1)
     - Research energy sources and endurance factors
     - Create initial UAV endurance model
     - Identify potential UAV platforms

2. **Safety & Legal Research:**
   - Research and document SHGM UAV regulations in `LEGAL_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`

   - Acquire basic safety equipment

### Short Term (1-2 Months)
- Complete first theory document (either propellants or UAV energy budget)
- Complete first simulation (either rocket performance or UAV endurance)
- Begin acquiring materials/components for initial bench testing

### Medium Term (3-6 Months)
- Complete 2-3 simulation modules from ARC A
- Build and test first airframe component
- Conduct first bench test (following full TEST_PLAN/REPORT process)

## Success Metrics

### Project Health Indicators
- ✅ Safety framework in place
- ⏳ Regular documentation updates
- ⏳ Test plans completed before every test
- ⏳ Test reports completed within 48 hours of testing
- ⏳ Risk log updated when incidents occur

### Learning Progress
- ✅ Have surface-level familiarity with rocket science concepts
- ✅ Can describe basic principles (Kepler's laws, rocket equation) at introductory level
- ⏳ Deep understanding of theory (requires much more study)
- ⏳ Can generate and validate simulation results
- ⏳ Can safely build and test hardware
- ⏳ Can analyze test data and iterate designs

## Notes

- No schedule pressure - depth over speed
- Document everything, even small experiments
- Safety is non-negotiable
- Honest self-assessment is more valuable than impressive claims
